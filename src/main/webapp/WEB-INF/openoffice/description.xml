        In order to avoid name clashes with other extensions it should probably hold

            MyFirstName.MyLastName.DictionayName
        or  www.MyWebpage.net.DictionayName

        For the very same reason they should NOT start with 'org.openoffice'.
        When choosing the identifier keep in mind that others may provide a dictionary for that
        very same language as well and even then your identifier still needs to be unique!
