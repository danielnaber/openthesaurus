vithesaurus - a web-based thesaurus management tool
Copyright (C) 2009 vionto GmbH, www.vionto.com

vithesaurus is a web-based tool for the development and maintenance of 
thesauri and ontologies. It requires a Java application server or
servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat, http://tomcat.apache.org) and is
typically used with MySQL as a stand-alone database (other databases may
work but have not been tested).


SETUP FOR USERS WHO INSTALL THE *.WAR FILE

The vithesaurus.war file needs to be deployed to your servlet container.
Please refer to the container's documentation on how to do that.

1. Copy your JDBC database connector *.jar file to the "WEB-INF/lib" directory.
   If you use MySQL, you can get the database connector at
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

2. Configure your database access in WEB-INF/classes/datasource.properties.  
   A typical MySQL-based configuration for datasource.properties looks like this:

   dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/vithesaurus?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8
   dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
   dataSource.username=dbuser
   dataSource.password=xyz
   dataSource.dbCreate=update

   With these settings, the database "vithesaurus" needs to be created first manually
   using the database's tools. The tables will be automatically created by vithesaurus
   on its first startup.

3. For now, an in-memory database needs to be set up and updated regularly by
   calling "synset/createMemoryDatabase" before vithesaurus can be used.
   This can be done by calling a command like this:
   curl -I http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus/synset/createMemoryDatabase

4. Set the values in WEB-INF/classes/vithesaurus.properties

5. For bigger data sets it might be necessary to created indexes manually in
   your database (later versions of vithesaurus might do this automatically):
   ALTER TABLE `term` ADD INDEX ( `word` ) 
   ALTER TABLE `term` ADD INDEX ( `normalized_word` ) 
   ALTER TABLE `synset` ADD INDEX ( `is_visible` ) 

6. In case you run into problems with searching for special characters, it might be
   required to modify all tables whose collation is "latin1_swedish_ci" to
   "utf8_general_ci", like this:
   ALTER TABLE `term` CHANGE `word` `word` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `term` CHANGE `normalized_word` `normalized_word` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `term` CHANGE `user_comment` `user_comment` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `wikipedia_links` CHANGE `link` `link` VARCHAR( 100 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `wikipedia_pages` CHANGE `title` `title` VARCHAR( 100 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;  
   ALTER TABLE `wiktionary` CHANGE `headword` `headword` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL ,
     CHANGE `meanings` `meanings` TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL ,
     CHANGE `synonyms` `synonyms` TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `old_value` `old_value` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `new_value` `new_value` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `class` `class` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `change_desc` `change_desc` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `ip_address` `ip_address` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `word` `word` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;    

7. The default administration account is "admin" with the password "admin" - make
   sure this is changed after your first login. If you are logged in as admin, the
   vithesaurus homepage will show a link to the administration page. 


BUILDING

If you want to build vithesaurus on your own you will need
Grails 1.1.1 (http://www.grails.org).

For development, your database needs to be configured in
grails-app/conf/datasource-dev.properties. Use "grails run-app"
to directly start the web-application in development mode. It is
then available at http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus.

Use "grails war" to build a web application which can be deployed to a Java
servlet container like Tomcat.


DATA IMPORT

Data from the old PHP version of OpenThesaurus can be imported by
calling http://localhost:8080/vithesaurus/import/index. Please check
the result carefully as it has only been tested with the German data
so far.
