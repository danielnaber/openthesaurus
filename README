OpenThesaurus is a web-based tool for the development and maintenance of
thesauri and ontologies. It requires a Java application server or
servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat, http://tomcat.apache.org) and is
typically used with MySQL as a stand-alone database (other databases may
work but have not been tested).


SETUP FOR USERS WHO INSTALL THE *.WAR FILE

The openthesaurus.war file needs to be deployed to your servlet container.
Please refer to the container's documentation on how to do that.

1. Copy your JDBC database connector *.jar file to the "WEB-INF/lib" directory.
   If you use MySQL, you can get the database connector at
   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

2. Configure your database access in WEB-INF/classes/datasource.properties.  
   A typical MySQL-based configuration for datasource.properties looks like this:

   dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/openthesaurus?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8
   dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
   dataSource.username=dbuser
   dataSource.password=xyz
   dataSource.dbCreate=update

   With these settings, the database "openthesaurus" needs to be created first manually
   using the database's tools. The tables will be automatically created by OpenThesaurus
   on its first startup.

3. For now, an in-memory database needs to be set up and updated regularly by
   accessing the page "synset/createMemoryDatabase" before OpenThesaurus can be used.
   This can be done by calling a command like this:
   curl -I http://localhost:8080/openthesaurus/synset/createMemoryDatabase

   Since the size of in-memory tables is 16M by default, after a while the above operation
   might start to fail (you will get 500 Internal Server Error as response at the above URL 
   and you will see "memWordsTmp is full" in your server logs. In this case what you need to
   do is increase max_heap_table_size in MySQL. You can use "SHOW VARIABLES" to see the current
   value of this variable in your installation.

4. Set the values in WEB-INF/classes/openthesaurus.properties

5. For bigger data sets it might be necessary to create indexes manually in
   your database:
   ALTER TABLE `term` ADD INDEX ( `word` ) 
   ALTER TABLE `term` ADD INDEX ( `normalized_word` ) 
   ALTER TABLE `synset` ADD INDEX ( `is_visible` ) 

6. In case you run into problems with searching for special characters, it might be
   required to modify all tables whose collation is "latin1_swedish_ci" to
   "utf8_general_ci", like this:
   ALTER TABLE `term` CHANGE `word` `word` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `term` CHANGE `normalized_word` `normalized_word` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `term` CHANGE `user_comment` `user_comment` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `wikipedia_links` CHANGE `link` `link` VARCHAR( 100 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `wikipedia_pages` CHANGE `title` `title` VARCHAR( 100 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;  
   ALTER TABLE `wiktionary` CHANGE `headword` `headword` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL ,
     CHANGE `meanings` `meanings` TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL ,
     CHANGE `synonyms` `synonyms` TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `old_value` `old_value` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `new_value` `new_value` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `class` `class` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NOT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `change_desc` `change_desc` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `ip_address` `ip_address` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;
   ALTER TABLE `user_event` CHANGE `word` `word` VARCHAR( 255 ) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL;    

7. The default administration account is "admin" with the password "admin" - make
   sure this is changed after your first login. If you are logged in as admin, the
   OpenThesaurus homepage will show a link to the administration page.


BUILDING

If you want to build OpenThesaurus on your own you will need
Grails 2.2.4 (http://www.grails.org).

For development, your database needs to be configured in
grails-app/conf/datasource-dev.properties. Use "grails run-app"
to directly start the web-application in development mode. It is
then available at http://localhost:8080/openthesaurus.

Use "grails war" to build a web application which can be deployed to a Java
servlet container like Tomcat.


DATA IMPORT

Data from the old PHP-based version of OpenThesaurus can be imported by
calling http://localhost:8080/openthesaurus/import/index. Please check
the result carefully as it has only been tested with the German data
so far.
